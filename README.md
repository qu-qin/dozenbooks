# dozenbooks

This is my personal side project. I just uploaded this project to github recently. It was developed on Bitbucket initially in 2015. 

I use this website www.dozenbooks.com almost every week, to search for eletricity books I'd love to read and send them to my Kindle automatically.


How to use this website:

1. You need to sign up a Sina (http://www.sina.com.cn/) account firstly in order to log in :)
2. Add "beambook.kindle@gmail.com" to your whitelist of your kindle account.

Please check the website details in the Screenshots folder.
