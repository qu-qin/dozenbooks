# dozenbooks

This is my personal side project. I just uploaded this project to github recently. It was developed on Bitbucket initially. 

I use this website www.dozenbooks.com every week, to search for electronic books I'd love to read and send them to my Kindle.


How to use this website:

1. You need to sign up a Sina (http://www.sina.com.cn/) account first :)
2. Add "beambook.kindle@gmail.com" to your whitelist of your kindle account.
